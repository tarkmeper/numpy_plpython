# numpy_plpython
Library to transform Postgres Array's to numpy array's directly without going through python lists.

* Note * This can't work at the moment due to a limitation on how transform functions work in Postgres.  This is a sample on how it _could_ work but actual implementation will need to wait until the transform function can be applied to array types.
